## Challenges

*Challenges not included at the moment.*

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/36/8/wrap-up):
>1. If you want to take this project further, you could start by having different kinds of obstacles â€“ the repeating rocks do get a bit tiresome after a while!
>2. You could also make the game difficulty ramp up ever so slowly, either by decreasing the gap between the rocks or by increasing the world gravity.
>3. To make the game much more challenging, how about introducing a secondary scoring mechanism: perhaps the player could get extra points if they fly through hoops in between the rocks?
>4. If you fancy a bigger challenge, how about making it a universal game, i.e. support both iPad and iPhone.
